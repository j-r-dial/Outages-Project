# Outages Project
**Step 1: Introduction**
Power outages are disruptive events that affect millions of people across 
the United States every year. Beyond just inconvenience, long electrical 
outages can impact emergency services, hospitals, economic activity, and 
public safety. Coincidentally, Hannah and Julia are both from the same hometown
in Virginia, where we experience regular power outages as a result of weather
events. We wanted to explore and understand where outages occur and why some
areas experience longer disruptions than others.
